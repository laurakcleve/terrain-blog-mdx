To paint this model I followed this excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O272Lk12p1o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorial from Sorastro</a>.

This project took a total of 89 hours, over 4 weeks. It's a stupid number of hours, I know. I used a lot of techniques I'm not very experienced with, but I think I got a few levels up.

I didn't take pictures with the goal of documenting a totally coherent process, but I hope they're somewhat interesting either way.

I also didn't do each step from start to finish in one go; I sometimes jumped around a lot, and the time shown for each one is a rough total.

# Assembly: 7 hours

![sprues](images/01-sprues.jpg)

The first two pieces. This is the center of the body.

![assembly 1](images/02-assembly-1.jpg)

The under-tail piece didn't fit right, unfortunately. Those top edges are supposed to be flush.

![assembly 2](images/03-assembly-2.jpg)

I had to chisel off a lot of the edges to get it close. You can see all the shavings in the corner.

![assembly 3](images/04-assembly-3.jpg)

In the end it came together pretty snugly.

![assembly 4](images/05-assembly-4.jpg)

Continuing on...

![assembly 5](images/06-assembly-5.jpg)

Assembling is kind of addicting, especially on such a big model. You can make a lot of progress very quickly and it's exciting to see it come together.

In hindsight I wish I would have taken the time to fill in the gaps and sand them smooth each time I added a piece, it would have been much easier to reach everything.

![assembly 6](images/07-assembly-6.jpg)

These pieces are for the face inside the beak.

### The dreaded tiny hands

Some of the hands on the wings are already built in, but 30 of them are not.

![hands sprue](images/09-hands-sprue.jpg)

This part took 3 of the 7 total hours of assembly.

The official build instructions showed incorrect placement for several of the hands, and I had to look at other build guides and do a lot of my own trial and error.

![attaching hands 1](images/10-hands-1.jpg)

I set aside and kept track of the hands that I couldn't find the right place for, while I moved on and attached the ones that were a definite fit.

![attaching hands 2](images/11-hands-2.jpg)

The last several were anyone's guess, and I used blue tacky to dry fit them before sealing their fate.

![attaching hands 3](images/12-hands-3.jpg)

Finally I can put the wings on.

![assembly 8](images/13-assembly-8.jpg)

Assembly complete!

![assembled](images/14-assembled.jpg)

The gaps are many and wide.

I know some people just leave them alone, but I just can't, especially on such an impressive mini.

# Gap filling/sanding: 14 hours

This is the finished filling. Almost all of it is Milliput; there's a little Vallejo plastic putty in there, but I only tried it on a few seams before I gave up after making a huge mess. I haven't figured out how to wield it yet.

![filling 1](images/19-filling-1.jpg)

![filling 2](images/20-filling-2.jpg)

![filling 3](images/21-filling-3.jpg)

![filling 4](images/22-filling-4.jpg)

![filling 5](images/23-filling-5.jpg)

It's always impossible to tell beforehand if the gaps will be smooth enough after painting.

# Priming: 2 hours

First a coat of solid black with an airbrush. I was prepared to go back and sand down any putty or mold lines that I missed, but it actually ended up clean enough.

![primed 1](images/24-primed-1.jpg)

I went ahead and did a grey zenithal highlight from above, then a white highlight from below to lay the foundation for the lighting coming from the pool.

![primed 2](images/25-primed-2.jpg)

Then I dry brushed the whole thing with white, to bring out the edges. It was particularly great for the feathers, which have so much detail.

# Base coat: 15 hours

![base coat 5](images/33-base-coat-5.jpg)

![base coat 6](images/34-base-coat-6.jpg)

# Building the base: 6 hours

I used bark chips and bits of cork to create a rocky ground. Above you can see the test base I made to see how the texture would turn out.

The bits of blue tacky are just marking where the model will sit.

![building base 1](images/35-building-base-1.jpg)

Testing the fit:

![building base 2](images/36-building-base-2.jpg)

And adding some skulls. They were the only bones we had.

![building base 3](images/37-building-base-3.jpg)

I filled everything in with a mixture of joint compound and sand.

![building base 4](images/38-building-base-4.jpg)

# Painting the base: 6 hours

Coated the base with Mod Podge to seal it.

![painting base 1](images/39-painting-base-1.jpg)

Then primed with black, a zenithal coat of grey, and some white to brighten up where the water will be.

![painting base 2](images/40-painting-base-2.jpg)

Finally the base colors.

![painting base 3](images/41-painting-base-3.jpg)

# Object source lighting: 4 hours

![osl 1](images/42-osl-1.jpg)

![osl 2](images/43-osl-2.jpg)

# Attaching the base: 2 hours

There was a bit of a gap around the model after gluing it on, so I had to go back and fill it in with more joint compound and sand.

![attaching base 1](images/44-attaching-base-1.jpg)

![attaching base 2](images/45-attaching-base-2.jpg)

Then added the Mod Podge again for sealing.

![attaching base 3](images/46-attaching-base-3.jpg)

After that I painted it to blend in with the ground as best I could.

# Water effects: 1 hour

I did three applications of Woodland Scenics realistic water, 24 hours apart. This is after the first application.

![water effects 1](images/47-water-1.jpg)

It looks perfectly smooth just after applying it.

![water effects 2](images/48-water-2.jpg)

But there is some shrinkage, and I did end up with a slightly bumpy surface.

This is the second coat, and the third smoothed it out a little more.

![water effects 3](images/49-water-3.jpg)

The last "step" to account for is the highlights and details; these totalled 30 hours, but are hard to show because I did some here and there in between other things, and didn't take good pictures of the progress. The wings (including the undersides) were 13 of those hours.

![wings](images/50-wings.jpg)

There are one or two touchups I would like to do, but I'm still pretty happy with it.
